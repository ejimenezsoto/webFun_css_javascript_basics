            <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments
                To provide control over them</p>
                <ul id="list">
                    <li>Variable Declaration JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - Imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup hold the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Var x;</li>
                    <li>ariable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. Var x = 10</li>
                    <li>Data Types Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are Java Script primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - “Coding Dojo Rocks!”; and Object - {first_name:’Jane’,last_name:’Doe’}
                    </li>
                    <li>Conditionals When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements : if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</li>
                    <li>Loops There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of time. Imagine how have to run a mile, well you run around the track your times and then you stop that’s a loop!</li>
                    <li>Function Functions are encapsulation of a code block, When we call our function this will run that cod block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.</li>
